## üß† Building Secure, Scalable Solutions: My Self-Assessment {#self-assessment}

Over the course of the Computer Science program at SNHU, I‚Äôve evolved from a novice developer into a strategic, security-focused engineer who builds narratable, modular, and professionally aligned applications. This ePortfolio reflects that transformation, showcasing the broader skills, values, and experiences I‚Äôve cultivated throughout the program. Through my years at SNHU, various assignments and projects challenged me to think critically about software architecture, security, and user experience.

Courses in software engineering, algorithms, databases, and cybersecurity laid the foundation for my technical depth, while the capstone project helped me synthesize those lessons into a cohesive, real-world application. For example, the CS-405 Secure Coding course bolstered me as a developer to think beyond functionality and to protect users, applications, and data through integrating secure practices at all possible points in the Software Development Lifecycle. An instance of this was protecting an application against buffer overflow due to a lack of user input validation, allowing for more characters to exceed the user input array‚Äôs limit. To prevent this, we checked input length, rejected oversized entries, cleared the input stream, and prompted the user to retry with fewer than 20 characters as follows:

```cpp
char user_input[20];

// Previously, the code allowed for unsafe input like this:
// std::cout << "Enter a value: ";
// std::cin >> user_input;

// Use getline to read input and prevent buffer overflow
while (true) {
    std::cout << "Enter a value (max 19 characters): ";
    std::cin.getline(user_input, sizeof(user_input));

    // Check if input was too long
    if (std::cin.fail()) {
        std::cin.clear(); // Clear error state
        std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n'); // Flush overflow

        std::cerr << "Input too long! Please enter fewer than 20 characters.\n";
    } else {
        break; // Valid input
    }
}

std::cout << "You entered: " << user_input << std::endl;
```
This experience taught me to anticipate edge cases and design defensively, which is a mindset I now apply across all projects.

Another great skill I developed during my academic career at SNHU is debugging code effectively to identify issues. One memorable time was while developing a pedometer mobile application in the Android Studio using SensorManager. To watch the application in more detail, I enabled breakpoints in the code and ran the application in debug mode.  Stepping through each breakpoint showed each update to variables based on the movement detected by the sensor:

Debugging in Android Studio sharpened my ability to trace sensor-driven logic and isolate variable state changes, a skill I‚Äôve carried into more complex systems.

## ü§ù Development, Collaboration, and Communication

While much of my development work was independent, I collaborated with peers through code reviews, discussion forums, and shared repositories such as GitHub. I practiced asynchronous teamwork by resolving merge conflicts, aligning shared goals, and giving constructive feedback. These experiences sharpened my ability to work in a team environment and adapt to different communication styles.
The following areas showcase application of my skills:

## üß© Core Competencies

- **Team Collaboration**  
  Throughout my tenure at SNHU as well as my professional experience, I have led and been member of small and large teams, fostering cross-functional team collaboration, fielding various communication styles, and supporting both direct and indirect efforts to achieve overall team impact. To support my efforts in this regard, I have experience using Visual Studio, Azure DevOps for story boards and code lifecycle management, GitHub, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and more. I value honesty, transparency, and direct language in collaborative situations.

- **Stakeholder Communication**  
  I enjoy championing projects and their requirements, objectives, milestones, and completion to both technical and non-technical audiences. Be it live presentations to leaders, training to users, or technical documentation, my aim is to always ensure that technical designs and solutions are easily understood to all audiences.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
  I apply core structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, and hash maps as needed to solve problems effectively. I‚Äôve implemented recursive and iterative algorithms for sorting, searching, and traversal. Additionally, I evaluate how fast an algorithm runs (time complexity: e.g. linear O(n) vs. quadratic O(n¬≤)) and how much memory it uses (space complexity: e.g. storing extra arrays, recursion stack depth) before choosing or implementing a solution. This helps me pick the most efficient and scalable approach, especially when handling large datasets, nested loops, or recursive functions. I balance algorithmic challenges between performance with maintainability.

- **Software Engineering & Database**  
  I design modern solutions using cloud and serverless architectures. I prioritize principles such as separation of concerns, clear comments and documentation, and debug/test tools and practices. I normalize database schemas, enforce validation rules, and optimize queries through indexing and thoughtful data modeling. I am comfortable with traditional relational on-premises database engines such as Microsoft SQL and Oracle, cloud NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, or serverless varieties such as Cosmos DB and DynamoDB.

- **Security**  
  I embed secure coding practices across all layers of development. This includes input sanitization, role-based access control, authentication and authorization, and schema enforcement. I‚Äôm familiar with threat modeling, OWASP guidelines, and cloud-based IAM policies. Protecting applications, data, and users are pinnacle concerns during the development process.

While I‚Äôve gained a wide range of skills, the best demonstration of my technical and strategic growth is captured in my capstone project: Enhancements to the MEAN stack Travlr Trip Listings app.

## Original Artifact: Travlr Project (CS465) {#original}

This is the original version of the Travlr MEAN stack application, created during CS 465: Full-Stack Development I (July - August 2025) before any enhancements were applied.

The artifact began as an Express server-rendered HTML/Handlebars implementation and was later refactored into a modular Angular Single Page Application (SPA) later in the class. This refactoring allowed me to apply Separation of Concerns (SoC), improve maintainability, and align with modern front-end architecture standards.

## Enhancement One: Software Design & Engineering {#enhancement-one}

This enhancement focused on modularizing the Angular frontend, implementing route guards, and adopting standalone architecture.

üîó <a href="https://github.com/joselgarza/cs465-fullstack/tree/enhancement-one" target="_blank">View Enhancement One Branch</a>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìò Read Enhancement Narrative</strong></summary>
<br>
<p><strong>Description of Artifact:</strong><br>
The original artifact for this enhancement was the Angular frontend portion of the Travlr Trip Listings MEAN stack app, created during CS465 (July‚ÄìAugust 2025).</p>

<p><strong>Justification for Enhancements:</strong><br>
The original application had only a single, all-access role and lacked user input validation and error handling. This enhancement focused on implementing role-based access control (RBAC) using Angular route guards and service-level authorization checks for both users and administrators. I also added reactive form validation to enforce data integrity and abstracted API calls into dedicated services to improve modularity and testability.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection on the Enhancement Process:</strong><br>
Professionally, I specialize in Identity and Access Management, but my experience has mostly been at the architectural or administrative level. This was my first hands-on implementation of RBAC as a developer, and I found it both enlightening and essential.</p>

<p>One challenge was identifying all the controls that should apply to administrators versus regular users. Testing was critical to ensure that UI/UX behavior remained intuitive while enforcing proper access restrictions. Abstracting API calls into services also helped make the codebase more modular and maintainable.</p>

<p>This enhancement aligns with the <strong>Software Design & Engineering</strong> outcome by improving maintainability, scalability, and security. It also supports the <strong>Security</strong> outcome through RBAC enforcement and the <strong>Professional Communication</strong> outcome through narratable architecture decisions, as detailed in the code review and enhancement documentation.</p>

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms & Data Structures {#enhancement-two}

This enhancement restored backend search functionality, refined regex validation, and handled edge cases.

üîó <a href="https://github.com/joselgarza/cs465-fullstack/tree/enhancement-two" target="_blank">View Enhancement Two Branch</a>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìò Read Enhancement Narrative</strong></summary>
<br>
<p><strong>Description of Artifact:</strong><br>
The original artifact for this enhancement was the backend portion of the Travlr Trip Listings MEAN stack app, created during CS465 (July‚ÄìAugust 2025).</p>

<p><strong>Justification for Enhancements:</strong><br>
The original application lacked search functionality and had limited support for flexible queries. This enhancement introduced a full-stack search feature that allows users to locate trips based on destination, tags, or description. I implemented fuzzy matching using MongoDB‚Äôs <code>$text</code> and <code>$regex</code> operators as well as added pagination with <code>skip</code> and <code>limit</code> parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection on the Enhancement Process:</strong><br>
Enhancing this artifact taught me how to sequence backend and frontend improvements for  clarity. I began by designing the search endpoint, then layered in full-text and fuzzy logic, followed by pagination and frontend integration. I faced challenges with JSON parsing errors, proxy misrouting, and variable scoping in the backend. These issues required methodical debugging and reinforced the importance of clear response formatting and defensive coding.</p>

<p>One key lesson was the importance of narratable fallback logic. When MongoDB‚Äôs <code>$text</code> search failed to match typos like ‚Äúdaweson,‚Äù the fuzzy fallback ensured that users still received relevant results. This layered approach reflects my ability to anticipate edge cases and design resilient systems.</p>

<p>I also learned to manage verbosity in backend logging. During testing, I logged entire result sets to the console, which became overwhelming. I refined this by summarizing result counts and search terms, maintaining traceability without sacrificing clarity. Through this process, I strengthened my ability to plan enhancements strategically, troubleshoot full-stack issues methodically, and narrate technical decisions.</p>

<p>This enhancement aligns with the <strong>Algorithms & Data Structures</strong> outcome through recursive logic, regex refinement, and search optimization. It also supports <strong>Security</strong> and <strong>Software Engineering</strong> by enforcing input validation and improving backend resilience.</p>

## Enhancement Three: Databases {#enhancement-three}

This enhancement added compound indexing, normalized schema inputs, and improved validation logic.

üîó <a href="https://github.com/joselgarza/cs465-fullstack/tree/enhancement-three" target="_blank">View Enhancement Three Branch</a>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìò Read Enhancement Narrative</strong></summary>
<br>
<p><strong>Description of Artifact:</strong><br>
The original artifact for this enhancement was the MongoDB database layer supporting the Travlr Trip Listings MEAN stack app, created during CS465 (July‚ÄìAugust 2025).</p>

<p><strong>Justification for Enhancements:</strong><br>
The original implementation lacked advanced indexing and schema validation. This enhancement focused on improving query performance, input integrity, and search capabilities. I added a <code>$text</code> index on key fields like destination and description, created compound indexes (e.g., destination + date), and enforced schema validation using Mongoose to prevent injection and ensure data consistency.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection on the Enhancement Process:</strong><br>
Enhancing this artifact taught me how to sequence backend and frontend improvements for narratable clarity. I began by refining the trip schema, ensuring the full text search, then layered in compound indexing, followed by frontend validation and backend query precision. I faced challenges with exact string matching, millisecond-level date alignment, and index usage verification. These issues required methodical debugging and reinforced the importance of data integrity and query design. I could still improve the search experience, further error handling, and more, but I wanted to stay within scope of this enhancement as well as the overall project.</p>

<p>One key lesson was the importance of validating index usage with <code>.explain()</code>. Even when indexes were defined correctly, MongoDB‚Äôs query planner required exact matches to trigger them. I learned to inspect stored values, adjust query formats, and use range queries when necessary. This reinforced my ability to debug backend logic with surgical precision. It was interesting to find that while compound searching required exact values, the search bar in the UI utilizes fuzzy search for a much better experience.</p>

<p>I also learned to align frontend validation with backend schema rules. By showing inline error messages as soon as fields were touched or typed into, I improved user experience and reduced backend rejections. This narratable polish reflects my empathy for users and attention to edge cases. Although I began with putting further constraints in the Angular forms, I found that the add-trip HTML did not deliver any handling messages to the admin, leaving them to fend for themselves on why they could not add a trip. I couldn‚Äôt leave it as is and further introduced input handling and validation which aligned to the previous database schema enhancements.</p>

<p>As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, when the form was being tested and bad or unexpected data hit the backend after the improvements, the server would crash and halt the website hosting. I identified that the <code>addTrip</code> function in the Trip class needed to handle the exception flagged by the newly introduced backend data validation properly. I did this with a <code>try/catch</code>. This was the result of the server operation, before and after:</p>

![Console output of web server before and after exception handling](images/exception_handling.png)

<p>As you can see, there was an expected validation error with ‚Äòcode‚Äô due to the Regex, but then npm would crash. After the <code>try/catch</code> handling, a proper 400 validation now logs in the console, allowing the server to continue normal operations.</p>

<p>Through this process, I strengthened my ability to plan enhancements strategically, troubleshoot backend issues methodically, and narrate technical decisions with clarity. I have found that, while introducing backend improvements, frontend improvements needed attention to really bring the value home. The nature of the full-stack application proved the same in the last enhancement when I introduced the search bar. Without the full text and fuzzy search at a minimum, the search bar would do nothing at all. The entire project experience has been rewarding overall, and it was a wise choice to scale back in my original plan when I did so that I could make all the required improvements holistically throughout the process.</p>
