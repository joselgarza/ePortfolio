## Professional Self-Assessment {#self-assessment}

Over the course of my Computer Science program at SNHU, I’ve grown from a capable developer into a strategic, security-focused engineer who builds narratable, modular, and professionally aligned applications. This ePortfolio showcases that evolution through a series of enhancements to the Travlr full stack application — each chosen to demonstrate technical depth, architectural clarity, and alignment with real-world expectations.

My specialization in secure full stack development is reflected in my approach to route guards, authentication flows, schema validation, and backend resilience. I sequence enhancements not just for technical impact, but for narratable clarity — ensuring each step is defensible, rubric-aligned, and professionally presentable.

### Course Outcomes Alignment

- **Software Design & Engineering (Outcome 1):** I refactored the Angular frontend into a modular, standalone architecture and implemented route guards to enforce role-based access control. These changes improved maintainability, scalability, and security.

- **Algorithms & Data Structures (Outcome 2):** I restored backend search functionality by debugging schema mismatches and refining regex validation. I handled edge cases methodically, ensuring robust and user-centric data handling.

- **Databases (Outcome 3):** I normalized schema inputs, added compound indexing, and improved validation logic to support efficient queries and secure data storage. These enhancements reflect real-world database design principles.

- **Security (Outcome 4):** Across all enhancements, I prioritized secure coding practices — from route guards and RBAC to input validation and schema enforcement. I also demonstrated awareness of authentication flows and data protection.

- **Professional Communication (Outcome 5):** This ePortfolio itself is a reflection of my ability to narrate technical work clearly and professionally. I’ve embedded code review videos, linked enhancement branches, and structured content for reviewer clarity.

### Final Reflection

I approach development with a pragmatic mindset — balancing ambition with feasibility, and always seeking narratable clarity. I troubleshoot methodically, adapt to modern paradigms, and design with empathy for users and reviewers alike. This ePortfolio is not just a showcase of code — it’s a reflection of who I’ve become as a developer: resilient, strategic, and ready to contribute meaningfully to the field.
